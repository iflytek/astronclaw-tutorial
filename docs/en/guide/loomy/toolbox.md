# Toolbox and Skill System

## Toolbox (MCP)
Loomy's toolbox function allows AI to connect and use various external tools, greatly expanding the boundaries of AI capabilities.

**Access Toolbox Settings**
Click "Settings" on the left menu bar of the application, and then select the "Toolbox" option to enter the toolbox configuration page.

## Skill System (Skills)

Loomy's skill system gives AI more professional capabilities to help you complete tasks in various office and life scenarios. From writing emails and processing spreadsheets to Xiaohongshu operations and stock analysis, every skill is an "ability" of the AI.

### What is a Skill?
Skills can be understood as the "professional abilities" mastered by large models. Every time you install a skill, it is equivalent to adding an ability to the AI. If you compare a large model to a person, skills are what this person can do. The more skills you install, the more tasks AI can help you complete.

> **For example**: As a Xiaohongshu self-media operator, you want AI to write a Xiaohongshu advertorial. After installing the "Xiaohongshu Card Generator" skill, AI can output professional content according to Xiaohongshu's style and requirements.

### Where to find Skills?
Click the "Skills" entry in the left menu bar of Loomy to view all official built-in skills.

![Find Skills](/loomy/skills/where_skills.png)

Click on any skill card to view the detailed description of the skill and set the AI's permission to call the skill. Permissions are divided into three types:

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| **Allow** | AI uses it directly when it judges it is necessary, without confirmation |
| **Ask** | AI will ask you for your consent before calling, and will only execute after confirmation |
| **Forbid** | Completely disable the skill, AI will not call it |

It is recommended to set "Allow" for frequently used skills in daily life, and "Ask" for skills involving sensitive operations (such as sending emails), which maintains efficiency while preserving control over key operations.

### How to use Skills?
Loomy provides two ways to use skills, making your work more flexible and efficient.

**Method 1: Shortcut Command "/"**
Enter `/` in the dialog box, and a skill selection menu will automatically pop up. After selecting the required skill and sending a message, AI will call the skill to complete the task.

![Shortcut Command Call](/loomy/skills/quick_skills.png)

**Method 2: AI Autonomous Recognition**
No need to manually select, AI will automatically search for matches among installed skills based on your input content, and automatically call the corresponding skill to complete the task after successful recognition.
*   When you say "Help me write a business email", AI will automatically call the "Email Drafting Assistant"
*   When you say "Analyze this Excel spreadsheet", AI will automatically call the "Excel Spreadsheet Expert"
